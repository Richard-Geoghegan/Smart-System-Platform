| src                 | A source directory, which contains a .R file for data tidying of the raw data. This file is not edited by student team members, but by the course coordinators. Depending on the level of data tidying that is needed to work with the collected raw data, course coordinators may provide some code for data tidying here. The aim is to provide students with a tidy data set as early as possible, so that exploratory analysis using data visualisation can be performed. | Course coordinators.                |
